# Knots 1.0
Knots is a simple web browser application built with C# and Windows Forms. It allows users to navigate to different websites, go back and forward in their browsing history, refresh the current page, and manage bookmarks/favorites.

Getting Started
To run Knots on your computer, you will need to have Visual Studio installed. You can download the latest version of Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website.

Once you have Visual Studio installed, you can clone this repository and open the solution file (Knots.sln) in Visual Studio. Then, you can build and run the application from within Visual Studio.

Usage
When you first open Knots, it will load the DuckDuckGo search engine as the home page. You can navigate to other websites by entering the URL in the address bar and clicking the "Go" button or pressing Enter.

You can also use the navigation buttons to go back and forward in your browsing history, refresh the current page, and stop loading a page that is taking too long to load.

To manage bookmarks/favorites, click the "Favorites" button. This will open a new window where you can add, edit, and delete bookmarks/favorites.
